# googlecalAI
This project combines the APIs of OpenAI and Google Calendar to work together to create schedules. The main goal is to have a web page where users can \
login to their Google accounts and ask an AI to schedule events for them based on information such as specific days, time periods, exceptions, and more. \
At the moment this is still a WIP and features may change.
